# Secretary System - Personal Assistant Skill Bundle

## Project Overview
Build a personal assistant system ("המזכירה") - a bundle of Skills that helps manage projects and ventures outside academic scope. The system will be built first in Claude Code (agents + skills), then migrated to Claude AI via packaging script.

## Architecture
- **Build Once, Instantiate Per Project** model
- Works in Claude Code as Agents AND as Skills
- Works in Claude AI as Skills only (after migration)
- Integrates with Taskmaster MCP for task management

## Phase 1: Claude Code Development

### Task 1: Setup Folder Structure
Create ~/skills/secretary/ with the following structure:
- references/ (sub-skill instructions)
- assets/ (templates)
- scripts/ (Python utilities)
- agents/ (Claude Code agent definitions)

### Task 2: Create Main Orchestrator Skill
Create SKILL.md with:
- YAML frontmatter (name: secretary, description with Hebrew+English triggers)
- Intent recognition (PROJECT_INIT, TASK_MANAGE, STATUS_CHECK, DELEGATION, BRAIN_DUMP)
- ADD Cycle governance (Assess-Decide-Do)
- References to sub-skill files

### Task 3: Create Project Brief Sub-Skill
Create references/project-brief.md:
- Transform brain dumps into structured briefs
- Template for project definition
- Interactive conversation flow

### Task 4: Create Task Engine Sub-Skill
Create references/task-engine.md:
- Task CRUD operations
- Taskmaster MCP integration (get_tasks, set_task_status, expand_task)
- Priority and dependency management

### Task 5: Create Delegation Advisor Sub-Skill
Create references/delegation-advisor.md:
- Agent profiles (Claude Code, Gemini, ChatGPT, Human)
- Task matching logic
- Prompt generation for handoffs

### Task 6: Create Project Logger Sub-Skill
Create references/project-logger.md:
- Activity recording
- History queries
- Project status summaries

### Task 7: Create Living Document Templates
Create assets/:
- brief_template.md
- tasks_template.md
- log_template.md

### Task 8: Create Claude Code Agents
Create agents/:
- secretary-orchestrator.md (with skills: secretary)
- project-initiator.md
- task-manager.md
- delegation-advisor.md
- project-logger.md

### Task 9: Create Utility Scripts
Create scripts/:
- init_project.py (initialize new project instance)
- sync_taskmaster.py (sync with Taskmaster MCP)

### Task 10: Deploy Agents to Claude Code
Deploy agents to ~/.claude/agents/ for cross-project availability

### Task 11: Test in Claude Code
Test Secretary System with a sample project:
- Create a test project brief
- Add and manage tasks
- Test delegation recommendations
- Verify logging

## Phase 2: Claude AI Migration

### Task 12: Create Packaging Script
Create scripts/package_skill.py:
- Validate SKILL.md
- Collect files (SKILL.md, references/*, assets/*)
- Exclude Claude Code specific files (agents/, scripts/)
- Create .skill ZIP archive

### Task 13: Migrate to Claude AI
- Run package_skill.py to create secretary.skill
- Upload to Claude AI settings
- Test in Claude AI

## Success Criteria
1. Secretary System responds to "מזכירה" and "secretary" triggers
2. Can create project briefs from brain dumps
3. Tasks sync with Taskmaster MCP
4. Delegation recommendations work correctly
5. Activity logging captures all actions
6. Works in both Claude Code and Claude AI
